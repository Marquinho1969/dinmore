# Patron Interactive Engagement

A system to help with the interpretation of works of art by  monitoring a patrons facial expression 

and providing feedback on the artwork they are viewing. By detecting age, gender and directed gaze the system could deliver content specific to the patrons area of interest and in a manner that is more likely to appeal to them.

For example, children viewing 'The Hay Wain' by John Constable might have a humorous story involving the animals depicted, something they are more likely to engage with and remember. Whilst older viewers would have more historical content delivered in the same voice as their gender. 

For larger artworks it is possible that a particular area of interest can be ascertained such as the cart, house or dog in The Hay Wain.

As well as improving the engagement with the artwork the system will be able to collect anonymous statistics on how a work was interacted with.

Reports currently envisaged would show breakdowns for age, gender, areas of focus, time and day and popularity.
