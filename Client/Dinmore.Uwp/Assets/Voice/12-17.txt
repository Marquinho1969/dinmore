This is the earliest panoramic view of Shrewsbury. It’s like a 1630s version of an iPhone panorama.
The scene isn’t really that accurate, but since it’s a painting the artist get’s to choose where they place things. 
If you look at the drawing to your left, it represents a more realistic picture of where things are located in Shrewsbury. 
Can you find the 5 tall buildings and the castle from the painting in the drawing? 
Looking at the drawing, where do you think, the artist would need to be standing to have seen the view which they have painted?
Look at the top left of the painting there is a tower, but its shorter than all the rest. That’s because it’s top was chopped off in the English civil war to stop anyone getting a good view of the town.
