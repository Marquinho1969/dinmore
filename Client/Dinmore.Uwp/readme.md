# Known bugs

* Remove overlay boxes when no results. Currently leaves the last box.
* Result boxes wrong size. Need to calculate correct position from api request details in state.
* Bounding box error. If you move near the edge of the screen, the bounding box goes outside and throws an error.

# Nice to do (will do from here if time allows);

* Annotate box overlays with age etc.
* Colour the logging rows depending on severity.
* Turn logging visibility on / off with click on main window.
* Show splitter when logging visible to allow resizing.
